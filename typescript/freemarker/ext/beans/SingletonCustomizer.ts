/**
 * Marker interface useful when used together with {link MethodAppearanceFineTuner} and such customizer objects, to
 * indicate that it <b>doesn't contain reference to the {link ObjectWrapper}</b> (so beware with non-static inner
 * classes) and can be and should be used in call introspection cache keys. This also implies that you won't
 * create many instances of the class, rather just reuse the same (or same few) instances over and over. Furthermore,
 * the instances must be thread-safe. The typical pattern in which this instance should be used is like this:
 * 
 * <pre>static class MyMethodAppearanceFineTuner implements MethodAppearanceFineTuner, SingletonCustomizer {
 * 
 * // This is the singleton:
 * static final MyMethodAppearanceFineTuner INSTANCE = new MyMethodAppearanceFineTuner();
 * 
 * // Private, so it can't be constructed from outside this class.
 * private MyMethodAppearanceFineTuner() { }
 * 
 * &#64;Override
 * public void fineTuneMethodAppearance(...) {
 * // Do something here, only using the parameters and maybe some other singletons.
 * ...
 * }
 * 
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * @since 2.3.21
 * @class
